## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Fixed the clang-UBSAN memtest note.
* Indicated the correction with a version bump to 0.11.2

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.3.3 and devel
* local Windows 10 (devel and release)
* Ubuntu precise 12.04.5 LTS (travis CI), R 3.3.2

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs or NOTEs on my installation of Windows, OS X, or Linux. 

## Downstream dependencies
The package update does not cause any issues for the one package that depends on it, to the best of my knowledge.
